Python Firmata is a python API for the firmata protocol.

The aim of this project is to allow developers to communicate with Arduino microcontrollers using Python.

Python Firmata were based on the Arduino library for Processing, and it works fine with Firmata 2.0.


* Getting started
	
Python Firmata requires pySerial (http://pyserial.wiki.sourceforge.net/pySerial) to work properly. Be sure you have uploaded the Firmata firmware (v2) to the Arduino board.

Take a look at the examples folder to see how it works.
